### Why you need a web server to view: 
Modern browsers block loading local JSON files directly due to CORS security restrictions. A local web server resolves this.

### Steps for Viewing
1. Download all project files to a folder

#### Option A: Using Python
2. Open terminal/command prompt in that folder
3. Run: `python -m http.server 8000`
4. Open browser and visit: `http://localhost:8000`

#### Option B: Using Node.js
2. Install Node.js if you haven't already
3. In the project folder, run: `npx http-server`
4. Open the URL provided in terminal

#### Option C: Using PHP
2. In the project folder, run: `php -S localhost:8000`
3. Visit: `http://localhost:8000`
