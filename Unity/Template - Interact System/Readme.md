## Interaction System Template
#### Based on the "How to talk to NPCs" tutorial by CodeMonkey | [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdoImzaY6M4 "Improved Interact System")
--- 
**Interactor**: Would most commonly be the Player

**Interactables**: Items that the character would interact with such as doors, collectables, and other objects that require the Interactor to trigger the interaction.

#### Notes regarding in-code comments:
* Any comment using "**Add**" refers to code needing to be completed in Visual Studio Code or similar coding software.
* Any comment using "**Assign**" refers to a task to be completed in the Unity Editor.
* Any comment using "**CAN CHANGE**" should specify what parts of the code can be adjusted in that line to meet different needs.
